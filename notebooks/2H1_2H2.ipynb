    "_Suppose that there are two species of panda bear. Both are equally common in the wild and live in the same places. They look exactly alike and eat the same food, and there is yet no genetic assay capable of telling them apart. They differ however in their family sizes. Species A gives birth to twins 10% of the time, otherwise birthing a single infant. Species B birth twins 20% of the time, otherwise birthing singleton infants. Assume that these numbers are known with certainty, from many years of field research.\n",
