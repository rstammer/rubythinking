Let's do the _Statistical Rethinking_ journey in Ruby!


### Hints

All solutions are given as Jupyter notebooks. For a better reading experience:
Note that I mostly employ [iruby-chartkick](https://github.com/Absolventa/iruby-chartkick)
for plotting graphs. As GitHub unfortunately cannot display the graphs by default,
please note there's a small button to view each notebook in on [nbviewer.jupyter.org](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/),
where the notebooks should appear completely.

### FAQ

**Q**: Which version of the book are you using?
**A**: The second edition!
